### "AI Will Replace Human Writers"
False. AI tools augment human creativity but can't replace:

Not necessarily. Well-edited AI content with human input is often indistinguishable from fully human-written content.

### "More Expensive = Better"
Price doesn't always correlate with quality. Choose based on your specific needs, not price alone.

1. **Better Integration**: Seamless workflow with other tools
